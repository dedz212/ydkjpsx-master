These files store content (Q&A, audio). Content is exported in .json files

To use it, you must have python installed (for now), the file to run must be in the same directory as the .glu files (if you want to export all the files at once in the current file location)

.vag is an audio file, to open it, use the program [VAGEDIT](https://archive.org/download/Sony-PSX-tools/VAGEDIT.zip)

If you want to export the game itself (you must have a .bin file with the game), use the [jPSXdec](https://github.com/m35/jpsxdec/releases/tag/v2.0) program
